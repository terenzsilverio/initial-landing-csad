	<blockquote align="justify">
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always find it fun to reminisce about my childhood<em><sup>1</sup></em>. Back to the days where the only things I had in mind were silly and childish ideas<em><sup>2</sup></em>.</p>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We really did not have a lot in retrospect<em><sup>3</sup></em>. I grew up in a simple family<em><sup>4</sup></em>. My father, working hard and making ends meet<em><sup>5</sup></em>. My mother, a woman of many things, manages a myriad of things<em><sup>6</sup></em>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, on the other hand, is nothing but an uncontrollable child with infinite energy<em><sup>7</sup></em>. How I miss those days<em><sup>8</sup></em>. Playing around all day and night<sup>9</sup>. No responsibilities to think of<em><sup>10</sup></em>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also did pretty well in grade school<em><sup>11</sup></em>. I was consistent with all of my grades<em><sup>12</sup></em>. Disciplined enough to make it to the cream of the crop<em><sup>13</sup></em>. I also played a lot of sports<em><sup>14</sup></em>. I played badminton, volleyball, and taekwondo<em><sup>15</sup></em>. I even competed in two events<em><sup>16</sup></em>! I still remember winning a bronze medal in taekwondo<em><sup>17</sup></em>. I did not pursue any sports after that<em><sup>18</sup></em>. Instead, I signed up for various organization such as Red Cross Youth Marikina Chapter and the Boy Scout of our school<em><sup>19</sup></em>. It was a great experience if you'll ask me<em><sup>20</sup></em>.

	<blockquote align="justify">
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My teenage years was one for the books<em><sup>1</sup></em>. All of the crazy things happened here if my memory serves me right<em><sup>2</sup></em>.</p>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accomplised quite a lot, academically speaking<em><sup>3</sup></em>. I joined quite a handful of contests, both school-wide and division, even regionals!<em><sup>4</sup></em>. I once joined a web design context for 2017 Division Technolympics in Marikina and places second bringing home a silver medal<em><sup>5</sup></em>. However, I cannot remember anything from then on that could have been supplemental for this class<em><sup>6</sup></em>. Well, it has been ages since then<em><sup>7</sup></em>!
	</p>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also did campus journaling<em><sup>8</sup></em>. Writing really is my passion<sup>9</sup>. I like to creatively account what I am feeling<em><sup>10</sup></em>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tenth Grade, I was selected to compete for the annual research festival<!--continue here--><em><sup>11</sup></em>. I had two other groupmates<em><sup>12</sup></em>. It was not easy since we had a lot of differences in personalities<em><sup>13</sup></em>. However difficult it may be, we still pulled through and finished our research paper on time despite the challenges<em><sup>14</sup></em>. By the time of the competition, we were all nervous because it was our first time<em><sup>15</sup></em>. It was also not an easy fit to maintain the reputaion of our school who dominates the district level<em><sup>16</sup></em>! How exciting it is to take a look at what happened back then<em><sup>17</sup></em>. I am happy to share that we won<em><sup>18</sup></em>. It was a great experience overall<em><sup>19</sup></em>. I learned a lot from it<em><sup>20</sup></em>.

	<blockquote align="justify">
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been a roller coaster ride for me, recently<em><sup>1</sup></em>. College really is a challenge<em><sup>2</sup></em>.</p>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More so in an in-person set up<em><sup>3</sup></em>. I spent my first two years online<em><sup>4</sup></em>. Of course those were the times I find easy<em><sup>5</sup></em>. Until the in-person classes on campus resumed<em><sup>6</sup></em>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meant bus and train rides even before the sun rises<em><sup>7</sup></em>. At first it was fun<em><sup>8</sup></em>. Until it became too taxing<sup>9</sup>. It even came to a point that I do not want to go to school anymore<em><sup>10</sup></em>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then I remembered <em>mahal pala tuition ko</em><em><sup>11</sup></em>. I have to make every cent of it worthwhile<em><sup>12</sup></em>. I need to make sure that every penny my parents spent on me will be worth it<em><sup>13</sup></em>. I do not wanna disappoint them<em><sup>14</sup></em>. So I will do my very best to soar heights<em><sup>15</sup></em>. I may not be that <em>genius</em>, but I can definitely work hard<em><sup>16</sup></em>! I was a college scholar in my freshman year<em><sup>17</sup></em>. I am hoping to repeat the same feat this year<em><sup>18</sup></em>. Other than recognition, I want money<em><sup>19</sup></em>. I get happy when there is money<em><sup>20</sup></em>.

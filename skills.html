	<blockquote>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I participated in quite a few competitions, both divisional and school-wide, even regionals! I once participated in a web design context for the 2017 Marikina Division Technolympics, where I placed second and won a silver medal. But I can't think of anything that happened after that that may have been extracurricular for this class. Well, it's been a very long time.

	<blockquote>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, I have participated in a variety of sports. I engaged in taekwondo, volleyball, and badminton. I even took part in two competitions! In taekwondo, I still recall taking home a bronze medal. I stopped participating in sports after that. Instead, I joined a number of organizations, including the Boy Scouts of our school and the Red Cross Youth Marikina Chapter. I also read books on my free time. My favourite author is Madelline Miller. I always get ecstatic when I am reminded of her writing style which is a classic.

	<blockquote>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kept a journaling career on campus as well. I'm incredibly passionate about writing. I enjoy artistically expressing my thoughts and feelings.Back then, I used to write poems but after a while stopped because of writerâ€™s block. I am still yet to return to creative writing. However, I still write news for the Dawn.
